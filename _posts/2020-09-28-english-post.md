I have started writing posts in English on this blog. All posts in English will be tagged `en`.

Since I am still not good enough in English, there will still be posts in Traditional Chinese and those posts will not have a dedicated tag. No plans to translate old posts or provide posts in both languages yet.

By posting in English, I hope more people find something useful here.
